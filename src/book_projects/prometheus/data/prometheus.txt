Scene I - Hephaestus’s Sorrow

In a remote mountainous region of Scythia.

[HEPHAESTUS enters with POWER and FORCE dragging PROMETHEUS with them in chains.]

POWER
Come on. Why wait and mope around like this so uselessly? Why do you not despise this deity who is so hateful to the other gods? He gave your special gift to mortal men.

HEPHAESTUS
We are comrades—we share strong common bonds.

POWER
That may be true, but can you disobey your father’s words? Do you not fear him more?

HEPHAESTUS
Ah yes! You always lack a sense of pity and are so full of cruel self-confidence.

POWER
There is no point in wailing a lament for this one here. You should stop wasting time on things that bring no benefits to you.

HEPHAESTUS
That may be true, but still I wish my lot as artisan had gone to someone else.
POWER
Well, every task is burdensome, except to rule the gods. No one is truly free except for Zeus.

HEPHAESTUS
I know. This work is proof enough of that. I cannot deny it.

POWER
Then hurry up and get these chains around him, just in case Zeus sees you stalling.

HEPHAESTUS
All right. These shackles here are ready. Take a look.

[HEPHAESTUS starts chaining PROMETHEUS’S arm to the cliff.]

POWER
Bind his hands. Use some heavy hammer blows and rivet him against the rock.

HEPHAESTUS
There! This part is finished. It looks all right.

POWER
Strike harder. Make sure he is securely fixed, with nothing slack. He is an expert at devising ways to wriggle out of hopeless situations.

HEPHAESTUS
Well, this arm, at least, is firmly nailed here. No one will get this out.

POWER
Now drive a spike in here as well—make sure it won’t come loose. No matter how intelligent he
is, he has to learn he is nothing but a fool compared to Zeus... Now smash the blunt tip of this adamantine wedge straight through his chest—use all your force.

HEPHAESTUS
Alas! O Prometheus, this suffering of yours—how it makes me weep!

POWER
Why are you so slow and sighing over Zeus’s enemy? Be careful, or soon you may be groaning for yourself.
HEPHAESTUS
This sight is difficult to watch, as you can see.

POWER
I see this criminal is getting just what he deserves. Come on, wrap these chains around his ribs.

HEPHAESTUS
Look, I know I have to carry out this work, so stop ordering me about so much.

POWER
Hold on—I’ll give you orders as often as I please and keep on badgering you. Move down, and use your strength to fix his legs in place...Hit the fetters really hard—those ones there, around his feet. The one who’s watching us, inspecting what we do, can turn vicious.

HEPHAESTUS
The words you speak well match the way you look.

POWER
Well, your soft heart can sympathize with him, but do not criticize my stubborn will and my harsh temper.

HEPHAESTUS
We should be going. His limbs are all securely fixed in place.

[Exit HEPHAESTUS, POWER, and FORCE]

Scene II - Hermes’ Indictment

[Enter the CHORUS of nymphs, daughters of OCEANUS, in a winged chariot, which hovers beside PROMETHEUS]

CHORUS
You need not fear us. We are yourfriends...

PROMETHEUS
Aaaiii! Alas! O you daughters born from fertile Tethys, children of your father Oceanus, whose current circles the entire world and never rests, look at me! See how I am chained here, nailed on this cliff above a deep ravine, where I maintain my dreary watch.

CHORUS
I see that, Prometheus, and a cloud of tears and terror moves across my eyes to observe your body being worn away in these outrageous adamantine chains. New gods now rule on Mount
Olympus, and, like a tyrant, Zeus is governing with new-fangled laws, overpowering those gods who were so strong before.
PROMETHEUS
Yes, and even though I am being tortured, bound in these strong chains, the day is coming when … he will be stripped of all his honours and his sceptre, too.

CHORUS
With that audacious confidence of yours, you do not cower before these bitter pains, but you allow your tongue to speak too freely...For the son of Cronos has a heart that is inflexible—his character will not be moved byprayer.

PROMETHEUS
Yes, I know. Zeus is a harsh god and holds the reins of justice in his hands.

CHORUS
But anyone who shows no pity for your agonies, Prometheus, has a heart of iron and is made out of rock. As for myself, I had no wish to see them, and now I have, my heart is full of grief.

PROMETHEUS
Yes, to my friends I make a most distressing sight.

[Enter HERMES]

HERMES
You devious, hot-tempered schemer, who sinned against the gods by giving their honours to creatures of a day, you thief of fire, I am here to speak to you.

PROMETHEUS
Your speech is crammed with pride and arrogance, quite fitting for a servant of the gods.

HERMES
But earlier with this wilfulness of yours you brought these torments on yourself.

PROMETHEUS
Know this—I would not trade these harsh conditions of mine for the life you lead as Zeus’s slave.

HERMES
I suppose you find it preferable to serve this rock than be a trusted messenger of Father Zeus.

PROMETHEUS
Insolence like yours deserves suchinsults.

HERMES
It sounds as if you find your present state a source of pleasure.

PROMETHEUS
Of pleasure? How I wish I could see my foes enjoying themselves the way I do. And I count you among them.

HERMES
From the words you speak I see your madness is no mild disease…you have not learned to demonstrate self-control in how you think.

PROMETHEUS
If I had that, I would not talk to you—to such a subservient slave.

HERMES
So then it seems, as far as what my father wants, you will say nothing.

PROMETHEUS
Well, obviously I owe him and should repay the favour.

HERMES
You taunt me now, as if I were a child.

PROMETHEUS
Well, are you not a child, or even stupider, to think you will learn anything from me? There is no torture, no form of punishment, that Zeus can use to force my mouth to speak before these vicious chains are taken off.

HERMES
You self-willed fool, for once you should submit, given the present torments facing you. Let your mind be ruled by what is right.

PROMETHEUS
It is pointless to pester me this way—as if you were advising ocean waves.

HERMES [to the CHORUS]
Ideas like these, expressed the way he does, are what we hear from those who are quite mad.

CHORUS
You will have to give me different advice and try to urge me in some other way in order to convince me. For I believe your stream of words is unendurable.

HERMES
As you wish—but remember what I said. Do not blame your luck when you are trapped in Ruin’s nets, and never claim that Zeus flung you into torments without warning.

[Exit HERMES
PROMETHEUS
And now things are already being transformed from words to deeds—the earth is shuddering, the roaring thunder from beneath the sea is rumbling past me, while bolts of lightning flash their twisting fire... The sky is now confounded with the sea. This turmoil is quite clearly aimed at me and comes from Zeus to make me feel afraid. O sacred mother earth and heavenly sky, who rolls around the light that all things share, you see these unjust wrongs I must endure!
